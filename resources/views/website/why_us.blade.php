                <h4>Validated weather information protocols</h4>
                <p>This work package will create a comprehensive overview over available data sources for meteorological
                    and other relevant environmental parameters, focusing on the aspects of agricultural pest control

                <p>This project therefore aims at documenting the insect pest species across different cropping systems
                    in Uganda, assessing their population dynamics across seasons and pest management approaches and
                    finally generating information.

                <h4>Telemetry Tracking of Insects</h4>
                <p>Design and implementation of a light-weight long-range insect  tracking  system utilizing passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. RFID offers the advantage of rapid and simultaneous insect detection and is less disruptive on insect behavior given the small size of the tags.</p>
