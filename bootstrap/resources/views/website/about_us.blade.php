            <p>The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in partnership with Makerere University (MAK),
                University of Juba (UoJ), Dar-es-salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) and University of Bergen (UoB)
                received a grant from NORAD, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation under its NORHED II
                programme. The project is titled â€œAdaptive Environmental Monitoring Networks for East Africa (AdEMNEA).

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <div style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
                    The AdEMNEA project will design, develop, and deploy a flexible network of data gathering and
                    monitoring stations for meteorological data as well as a wide variety of data including audio,
                    image, and video data as well as field reports and telemetry data, integrating both existing sensing
                    platforms and customised components for specific research areas targeting Climate Change and Natural
                    Resources. These data points will be aggregated through resilient and energy-efficient ICT networks
                    from the field to researchers conducting data analysis using machine learning, pattern recognition,
                    and other artificial intelligence and analytical methods in order to support researchers in the
                    application domain. The targeted application domains will be weather monitoring, building on the
                    results and infrastructure established in the NORHED WIMEA-ICT project, and using this data together
                    with the additional sensing and measurement sources to support researchers initially in the
                    entomology domain.
